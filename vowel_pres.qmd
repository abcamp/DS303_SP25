## The COT-CAUGHT Merger

::: footer
The COT-CAUGHT Merger
:::

::: incremental
-   Mergers refer to sound changes in which two distinct words become the same over time
-   This is often regional and/or generational
-   The COT-CAUGHT merger refers specifically to the words *cot* and *caught*
-   Do these words sound distinct to you?
-   What about *bot/bought, pond/pawned, nod/gnawed*?
:::

## The COT-CAUGHT Merger in US English

::: footer
The COT-CAUGHT Merger
:::

-   This merger in US English involves two low back vowels:\
    /ɑ/ and /ɔ/
-   These two vowels are near each other in the vowel space
-   The result of the merger is that *cot* and *caught* become homophones

## What factors influence the Merger?

::: footer
The COT-CAUGHT Merger
:::

-   **Regional Variation:** Found in both urban and rural areas; varies even within regions
-   **Age & Change:** Younger speakers show merger more than older ones
-   **Partial Mergers:** Some merge only in casual speech or certain contexts

## Regional Variation in the US

::: footer
The COT-CAUGHT Merger
:::

-   **The West**: The merger is nearly complete across the region
-   **The Northeast** and **Inland North**: The contrast is strongly preserved
-   **The Midwest**: The pattern is mixed — younger speakers often merge, older speakers usually don’t
-   **The South**: The merger is less common, though scattered pockets exist

## Research Question

::: footer
Research Question
:::

-   A few years have passed since there was a large-scale investigation into the distribution of the merger
-   In that time, media may have accelerated the distribution

::: {.fragment .highlight .center-align}
What is the current state of the distribution of the 
COT-CAUGHT merger and can this be predicted by region?
:::

## Data

::: footer
Data
:::

-   13 speakers (4 women, 9 men) from a university class
-   Speakers from a range of US regional backgrounds
-   Data collected for a larger project; relevant subset contains 78 total observations:
    -   13 speakers × 2 items × 3 repetitions
-   26 variables, including:
    -   F1 and F2 to characterize the vowels
    -   home state, to examine regionality

## F1 and F2

::: footer
Data
:::

-   F1 and F2 refer to the first and second formants
-   F1 and F2 are used to describe and define vowels across two dimensions:
    -   F1 is inversely related to tongue height
    -   F2 is related to frontness (vs. backness)

## The vowel space

  df[cols] <- lapply(df[cols], as.factor)
  return(df)

all_data$gender <- all_data$sex

## All vowels

  group_by(ppt, ipa) %>% # notice that we added ppt as a grouping
  mutate(
    f1_z = (f1 - mean(f1)) / sd(f1),

```

## Examining Outlier Values

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(merger, aes(f2, f1, color = ipa)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_reverse() +
  scale_y_reverse()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(merger, aes(x = f2, y = f1, color = ipa, label = home_state)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_reverse() +
  scale_y_reverse()

ggplotly(p) %>%
  layout(height = 400)
```

## Analysis and Results

::: footer
Analysis
:::

-   In my analysis, I included models for examining the relationship between:

    -   Descriptive stats for F1 and F2

    -   Word and F1/F2

    -   Home State and F1/F2

    -   Age, Gender, Ethnicity, and F1/F2

## F1 and F2 Means

::: footer
Analysis
:::

```{r, echo=TRUE}
merger %>%
  group_by(word) %>%
  summarise(
    f1_min = min(f1, na.rm = TRUE),
    f1_mean = mean(f1, na.rm = TRUE),
    f1_max = max(f1, na.rm = TRUE),
    f2_min = min(f2, na.rm = TRUE),
    f2_mean = mean(f2, na.rm = TRUE),
    f2_max = max(f2, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

## Word and F1

::: footer
Analysis
:::

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(lmer(f1 ~ word + (1|ppt), data = merger))
```

## Word and F2

::: footer
Analysis
:::

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(lmer(f2 ~ word + (1|ppt), data = merger))
```

## Preliminary Finding: Word

::: footer
Analysis
:::

There is a significant effect (*p* \< 0.5) of word for predicting F1 and F2.

-   This means that a difference between *cot* and *caught* was observed, at least in some cases

-   This means that the merger is *not* "complete" in this sample

## Adding Home State to the Model (F1)

::: footer
Analysis
:::

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(lmer(f1 ~ word * home_state + (1|ppt), data = merger))
```

## Adding Home State to the Model (F2)

::: footer
Analysis
:::

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(lmer(f2 ~ word * home_state + (1|ppt), data = merger))
```

## Preliminary Finding: Home State

::: footer
Analysis
:::

There is no significant main effects of `home_state` and no interactive effect with `word`

-   This means that no region shows a distinctly bigger or smaller *cot*–*caught* difference than others
-   There's no clear difference between *cot* and *caught* overall, which likely means they’re similar for many speakers

## Conclusion

::: footer
Conclusion
:::

-   There is evidence of a difference between *cot* and *caught* in both F1 and F2 across speakers

-   However, this difference is not significant across regions — some speakers are merged, some are not

-   The results point toward an <span class="highlight">incomplete or in-progress merger</span>

## Data Limitations

::: footer
Limitations
:::

-   Small, unbalanced data set
-   Not enough tokens or participants
-   Maybe looking at Euclidian Distance would be helpful?

## Euclidean Distance

**Euclidean distance** measures the straight-line distance between two points in vowel space (based on F1 and F2); a smaller distance means the vowels are more similar, indicating possible merger
